# Pair-trading
Pair trading is the idea that a pair of stock that tend to converge and meet their equilibrium over time. The goal of pair trading is to monitor stocks that trend together and identify when they begin to diverge. By buying the undervalued equity and selling the overvalued equity, we capture the convergence back to equilibrium.
